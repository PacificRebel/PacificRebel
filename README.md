**nice to meet you!** üëã.  

I'm a Full Stack / Front End Developer, working in React (currently obsessing over Gatsby) and Ruby/Rails. I'm also a <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/">Channel 4 News journalist</a> and I can't help refreshing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> front page several times an hour. Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/PacificRebel/CV">CV</a> below. üëáüèª  
Meanwhile, here's me drinking coffee by a dirty window - but it's sunny!

## Full Stack / Front End Developer with TV news background üé¨

### I'm a full stack developer, a recent graduate of the Makers bootcamp in London and journalist at Channel 4 News.  
I'm particularly excited about front end work, especially building beautiful, user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages. I'm currently building different types of apps with React and Gatsby, for example a couple of API call apps (my portfolio, and New York Times top story app)  and I'm
really interested in the SEO and responsive web design opportunities Gatsby offers.  

I love it when something small I've built elicits reactions of wonder from those I demo it to! For example, I've recently built and deployed
websites with birthday greetings for friends and family instead of cards - exciting to receive, and great for the environment too.   

I want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally drawn into it as a career, especially girls.  
I got into programming myself thanks to a RailsGirls workshop, and have been coding with my daughter on Sphero Edu and Scratch.  
Inclusive design fascinates me and I want to become good at it - I knew the issues but Chimmy Kalu's talk at this year's Women Driven Development conference was an eye-opener for me.  

I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of my company's Sustainability Forum, where we work to reduce carbon footprint.
