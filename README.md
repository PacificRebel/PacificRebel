## Channel 4 News journalist üé¨ and Full Stack / Front End Developer  

I've always been known as a tech specialist at work, but wanted to learn to code after reading about the lack of diversity in the programming, especially the issues caused by biased facial recognition AI. <a  href="https://www.codedbias.com/">"Coded Bias"</a> is a gripping illustration of this.   
    
I want to become good at inclusive design - <a href="https://www.chimmykalu.com/">Chimmy Kalu</a>'s talks have been an eye-opener for me.  

Since my bootcamp, I've focused on writing apps with React and Swift, and improving my front-end skills by doing a Sketch course. I'll work to get certification for HTML/CSS/Javascript next. I'll need these skills for a future work project, which is exciting.  

I love it when something small gives people joy, for example,
    <a href="https://fancy-croquembouche-09c52b.netlify.app/">simple birthday greeting websites</a> I've built for friends and family instead of cards - that one is built with Gatsby.
