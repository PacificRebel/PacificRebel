**nice to meet you!** üëã.  

I'm a Full Stack / Front End Developer, working in React (currently obsessing over Gatsby) and Ruby/Rails. I'm also a <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/">Channel 4 News journalist</a> and I can't help refreshing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> front page several times an hour. I'm a big fan of Helsingin Sanomat dynamic stories - this is my favourite: <a href="https://dynamic.hs.fi/2020/bodom/">Mysteeri, joka ei vanhene koskaan</a>. Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/PacificRebel/CV">CV</a> below. üëáüèª  
Meanwhile, here's me drinking coffee by a dirty window - but it's sunny!

## TV News journalist üé¨ and Full Stack / Front End Developer

### I'm a Full Stack Developer, graduate of the Makers bootcamp in London and journalist at Channel 4 News.  
I'm particularly excited about front end work, especially building beautiful, user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages. I'm currently building different types of apps with React and Gatsby, for example a couple of API call apps (my portfolio, and a New York Times top story app)  and I'm
really interested in the SEO and responsive web design opportunities Gatsby offers.  

I love it when something small I've built elicits reactions of wonder from those I demo it to! For example, I've recently built and deployed simple
    <a href="https://wizardly-lumiere-aae737.netlify.app/">websites with birthday greetings</a> for friends and family instead of cards - exciting to receive, and great for the environment too.   

I want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally drawn into it as a career, especially girls.  
I got into programming myself thanks to a RailsGirls workshop. I've coded with my daughter on Sphero Edu and Scratch, and now encourage her to participate in my projects.  
    
Inclusive design fascinates me and I want to become good at it - I knew the issues, but <a href="https://www.chimmykalu.com/">Chimmy Kalu</a>'s talk at last year's Women Driven Development conference was an eye-opener for me.  

I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of my company's Sustainability Action Team, which works to reduce ITN's carbon footprint.
