### Hi I'm Heli, 👋 
**nice to meet you!**
I'm a full stack / front end developer, currently working on my portfolio page in React. I'm also a TV news journalist and I can't help refreshing the New York Times front page several times an hour. Please check out my CV and repos below. 👇🏻 Meanwhile, here's me drinking coffee by a dirty window!
