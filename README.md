**nice to meet you!** 👋.  

I'm a Full Stack / Front End Developer, working in React and Ruby/Rails. I'm also a <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/">Channel 4 News journalist</a> and I can't help refreshing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> front page several times an hour. Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/PacificRebel/CV">CV</a> and repos below. 👇🏻  
Meanwhile, here's me drinking coffee by a dirty window - but it's sunny!
