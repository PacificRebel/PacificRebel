I'm a big fan of the New York Times'</a> and Helsingin Sanomat dynamic stories - these are so powerful: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacre.html">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> and <a href="https://dynamic.hs.fi/2020/bodom/">Mysteeri, joka ei vanhene koskaan</a>.

## Channel 4 News journalist üé¨ and Full Stack / Front End Developer

I'm particularly excited about writing user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages and I'm currently building with Swift and React (scroll down for details). I'm topping up my React skills with Pluralsight courses in my free time - more fun than just working on your own!  

I love it when something small gives people joy, for example,
    <a href="https://wizardly-lumiere-aae737.netlify.app/">simple birthday greeting websites</a> I've built for friends and family instead of cards.

I want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally drawn into it as a career, especially girls, and I got into programming myself thanks to a RailsGirls workshop.

Inclusive design fascinates me and I want to become good at it - <a href="https://www.chimmykalu.com/">Chimmy Kalu</a>'s talk at last year's Women Driven Development conference was an eye-opener for me.  

I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of my company's Sustainability Action Team, which works to reduce <a href="https://www.itn.co.uk/">ITN's</a> carbon footprint.
